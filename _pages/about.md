Hi, I am LI Kai(李鍇), Wechat:kaili37. I am now a PhD student at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences ([UCAS](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/)) and also undergoing a joint PhD project in City University of Hong Kong ([CityU](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/)). In UCAS, I am supervised by [Prof. Zhongming Zhao](http://www.aircas.cas.cn/ykjs/lrld/202505/t20250521_7789207.html) and [Prof. Yu Meng](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0010249). In CityU, I am supervised by [Prof. Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/) in Applied Machine Learning Lab ([AML](https://aml-cityu.github.io/)). 


In 2021, I obtained a bachelor's degree in space information and digital technology from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/)). I ranked 2nd in my major and was recommended to the UCAS to study directly for a doctor's degree. I used to be an intern at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us) advised by [Runze Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=o41-Nj8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). 

My researches focus on computer vision and remote sensing images. Recently, most of my work will concentrate on Off-Nadir Images. I proposed a very important concept, "Offset Token", in Off-Nadir Images, which bridged the gap between the former building-related model and transformer-based foundation models. In the future, I will dedicate myself to establishing a more comprehensive knowledge system for "Offset Token". If you are interested in my work, please contact me.

I am very into doing sports, like playing football and table tennis. I used to serve as a school representive in UESTC for table tennis, but I spend most of my time on football. If you are in Hong Kong or Beijing, contact me, we can play together!

I love music and I can play guitar, and I used to have a very lovely band. Latestly, I am practicing some solo with electronic guitar. 

I am also collecting stamps and postcards. In weekend, I prefer to sending some DIY postcards to some of my pen friends, which were printed from my photography portfolio. 

So, contact me! No matter for academics, sports or my postcards!
